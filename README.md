# CPPandOOP-Projects

This repository contains projects developed as part of a Udemy course focused on C++17 and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each project is designed to apply newly learned concepts, either by creating a new application or enhancing an existing one. 

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Hospital System
**Concepts Applied:**  
- Printing, Data Types, and Variables  
- Operators, Selection Statements, and Loops  
- Arrays, Functions, and Recursion  

**Description:**  
A simple hospital management system that handles patient records and specialization details. The system supports a fixed number of specializations, each with a maximum capacity for patients. Patients can be categorized as either regular or urgent, influencing their queue priority. Key functionalities include:  
- Adding a patient based on their urgency status  
- Retrieving a patient's record  
- Managing patient queues for each specialization  

More projects will be added as new concepts are covered in the course. Stay tuned!
